On this text file I will be explaining the commands I use on steps 5 and 6.

Exercise 5:

First, we use the command Desktop\DAM\Exercise_unit_5 to navigate through our folders. 
The directory is already initialized as a git repository from the firsts steps. If it wasn't, we would have needed to use the command git init to do it.
After that, we write "The hare and the turtle.txt" to open the file we want to modify.
Once we have modify it, we use the command git add . to stage the changes. 
Then we use the command git commit -m "Commit step 5" to commit the changes.
Lastly, we push the file to our GitHub repository using git push. 

Exercise 6:

We just need to repeat the steps on the Exercise 5. Once we have created the new file, we just need to stage it, commit it and push it. 
We are already in the right folder and the directory is already initialized so we don't need to do anything before.
We are just going to stage it with git add ., commit it with git commit -m "Commit step 6" and push it with git push.
